# SommOS E2E Test Suite - Status Report

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Developer**: QA Engineer  
**Status**: 🟡 Tests Created, Authentication Issue Discovered

---

## 📊 Summary

I've successfully created a comprehensive E2E test suite for SommOS using Playwright. **49 of 60 smoke tests passed** across multiple browsers and devices. However, I've discovered a CSS visibility issue in the authentication flow that needs to be addressed.

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Critical Issue: Authentication Form Visibility

**Problem**: The login form inputs have a grandparent element with `display: none`, making them not interactable by Playwright.

**Evidence**:
```javascript
Email input styles: {
  "display": "inline-block",    // ✅ OK
  "visibility": "visible",        // ✅ OK
  "opacity": "1",                 // ✅ OK
  "grandparentDisplay": "none"    // ❌ PROBLEM
}
```

**Impact**: 
- Auth fixtures cannot fill login form
- All tests requiring authentication are blocked
- ~108 inventory/PWA/a11y tests cannot run

**Root Cause**:
The HTML structure in `frontend/index.html` has the form nested in a way where a parent element is hidden:

```html
#auth-screen (visible)
  └── .auth-card
      └── .auth-panels (display: none ?)
          └── #member-login-panel.active (display: block)
              └── form
                  └── #login-email (cannot interact)
```

---

## 🔧 Recommended Fixes

### Option 1: Fix CSS Structure (Recommended)
Update the auth screen CSS to ensure all parent elements of active panels are visible:

```css
/* In frontend/css/styles.css or relevant file */
.auth-panel {
  display: none; /* Hidden by default */
}

.auth-panel.active {
  display: block; /* Show when active */
}

/* Ensure parent container is always visible */
.auth-panels-container {
  display: block !important; /* Or remove display: none */
}
```

### Option 2: Update Auth Fixture (Workaround)
Use JavaScript to interact with the form instead of Playwright's built-in fill:

```typescript
// In tests/e2e/fixtures/auth.ts
await page.evaluate(({ email, password }) => {
  document.getElementById('login-email').value = email;
  document.getElementById('login-password').value = password;
}, { email: credentials.email, password: credentials.password });

await page.click('#login-submit');
```

### Option 3: Enable Auth Bypass for Tests
Set environment variable to bypass auth in test mode:

```bash
# In .env or playwright.config.ts
SOMMOS_AUTH_TEST_BYPASS=true
```

Then update tests to work without login flow.

## 📈 Test Coverage

| Feature | Tests Created | Can Run | Status |
|---------|---------------|---------|--------|
| Smoke/Basic | 10 | ✅ Yes | 81.7% pass |
| Authentication | 4 | ⚠️ Partial | Blocked by CSS |
| Inventory CRUD | 18 | ❌ No | Needs auth |
| PWA/Offline | 24 | ❌ No | Needs auth |
| Accessibility | 15 | ❌ No | Needs auth |
| **Total** | **71** | **10** | **14% runnable** |

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (to unblock tests)
1. **Fix CSS visibility issue** (Option 1)
   - Inspect `frontend/index.html` and `frontend/css/styles.css`
   - Find the parent container with `display: none`
   - Ensure `.auth-panel.active` makes all parents visible

2. **Test the fix**
   ```bash
   npm exec playwright test tests/e2e/diagnostic-login.spec.ts
   ```

3. **Run full inventory test suite**
   ```bash
   npm exec playwright test tests/e2e/inventory-crud.spec.ts --project=chromium
   ```

### Short-term (after auth fix)
4. **Run all tests across all browsers**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

5. **Fix browser-specific failures**
   - Firefox console error filters
   - WebKit service worker compatibility
   - Mobile viewport adjustments

6. **Add data-testid attributes** to UI elements
   - Currently using ID selectors (brittle)
   - Should migrate to `data-testid` (stable)

### Long-term
7. **Create CI/CD workflow** (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`)
8. **Add visual regression tests**
9. **Add performance benchmarks**
10. **Expand to pairing and procurement views**

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **PWA Service Workers**: Need special handling in WebKit/Safari
2. **Auth Screen**: Has complex CSS that hides form inputs
3. **Mobile Testing**: Works well with iPhone 14, Pixel 7, iPad Pro emulation
4. **Axe-core**: Integrates seamlessly for accessibility testing
5. **Parallel Execution**: 3 workers locally, 50% on CI for optimal speed
