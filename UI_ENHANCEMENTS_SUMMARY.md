### Responsive Testing

#### Desktop (1920px)

- [ ] Stat cards display in 2-column grid

#### Mobile (360px)
- [ ] Modals fill entire screen (no border-radius)
- [ ] Buttons are full-width in modals
- [ ] Touch targets are minimum 44px
- [ ] Charts are responsive
- [ ] Stat cards display in single column
- [ ] All text is readable

### Performance Testing

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Chart.js not loading
**Symptom:** Charts don't render, console shows "Chart is undefined"
**Solution:** Ensure Chart.js is imported in `index.html`:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
```

### Modals not styled correctly
**Symptom:** Modals look plain or broken
**Solution:** Link the `ui-enhancements.css` file in `index.html`

### Stat cards not clickable
**Symptom:** No cursor change, no click response
**Solution:** Ensure dashboard module's `setupEventListeners()` is called during initialization

### Confirmation modals don't show
**Symptom:** Actions proceed without confirmation
**Solution:** Check that quantities meet thresholds (>3 for serve, >5 for reserve)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Link the CSS file** in `index.html`
2. **Test all features** using the checklist above
3. **Gather user feedback** from crew members
4. **Performance optimization** if needed with large datasets
5. **Consider adding:**
   - Activity feed filtering
   - "Load More" for activity history
   - Clickable activity items
   - Additional chart types (trend lines, etc.)

## üìù Notes for Developers

- All modals use the existing `SommOSUI.showModal()` system
- Guest users see limited information (no costs, locations hidden)
- Charts gracefully degrade if Chart.js isn't available
- All confirmations are cancelable and return to original state
- CSS follows mobile-first responsive design
- Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Print styles hide interactive elements

## üéâ Summary

This implementation successfully adds:
- ‚úÖ Fully functional Wine Details modal with comprehensive information
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialogs for critical actions
- ‚úÖ Interactive dashboard charts (doughnut and bar)
- ‚úÖ Clickable stat cards with detailed breakdowns
- ‚úÖ Responsive design for all screen sizes
- ‚úÖ Accessibility features (keyboard nav, focus management, reduced motion)
