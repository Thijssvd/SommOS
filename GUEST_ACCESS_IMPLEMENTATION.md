## 🚀 How to Use

### For Guests

1. **Visit the login page** at `http://your-server.com`
2. **Click the "Guest Access" tab**
3. **Enter your event code** (provided by crew)
4. **Check "This code requires a PIN"** if needed and enter PIN
5. **Click "Join as Guest"**
6. **Browse the wine collection** with read-only access

### For Crew/Admins

#### Creating Guest Invites (via API)

```bash
# Login first (save cookies)
curl -c cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@sommos.local","password":"your-password"}'

# Create guest invite without PIN
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/invite \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "wine-tasting-event@local",
    "role": "guest",
    "expires_in_hours": 24
  }'

# Create guest invite with PIN
curl -b cookies.txt -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/invite \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "private-event@local",
    "role": "guest",
    "expires_in_hours": 48,
    "pin": "1234"
  }'
```

#### Using the Test Script

```bash
# Make sure your backend is running first
cd /Users/thijs/Documents/SommOS
./scripts/test-guest-access.sh
```

This will:
- Create test guest invites (with and without PIN)
- Test guest login flows
- Verify read/write access permissions
- Display event codes you can use to test the UI
