# Frontend Performance Baseline Metrics

**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Purpose**: Pre-optimization baseline for Frontend Specialist agent

---

## JavaScript Bundle Sizes (Uncompressed)

### Critical Files
- **app.js**: 214KB ⚠️ TOO LARGE - Target: <100KB gzipped
- **api.js**: 38KB ✓ Acceptable
- **sw.js**: 13KB ✓ Acceptable

### Supporting Files
- performance-dashboard.js: 26KB
- glossary-data.js: 26KB
- performance-monitor.js: 22KB
- ui.js: 21KB
- performance-integration.js: 17KB
- image-optimizer.js: 17KB
- wine-card-optimized.js: 16KB
- sync.js: 14KB

### Totals
- **Total JavaScript**: 496KB (uncompressed)
- **Build Output**: 680KB (dist/ directory)
- **Estimated Gzipped**: ~150-180KB (assuming 30-35% compression)

## Optimization Targets

### Priority 1: Bundle Size Reduction
- [ ] Reduce app.js from 214KB to <100KB (gzipped)
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for feature modules
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports for Chart.js
- [ ] Split large modules into smaller chunks

### Priority 2: Service Worker
- [ ] Measure cache size (currently unknown)
- [ ] Implement cache size limits (<2MB target)
- [ ] Add cache versioning and cleanup

### Priority 3: Performance Metrics
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (baseline scores unknown)
- [ ] Measure First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- [ ] Measure Time to Interactive (TTI)
- [ ] Document Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)

---

## Known Issues

1. **Large app.js**: 214KB is too large for offline-first PWA
2. **No loading skeletons**: Poor UX during async operations
3. **Limited error handling**: Errors may cause white screens
4. **Cache size unknown**: Need to measure Service Worker cache
5. **No performance budgets**: No alerts when metrics degrade

---

## Success Criteria

After optimization, we should achieve:
- ✅ app.js <100KB (gzipped) - 50% reduction
- ✅ Total bundle <200KB (gzipped) - from ~160KB to <200KB
- ✅ Service Worker cache <2MB
- ✅ Lighthouse Performance score >90
- ✅ First Contentful Paint <1s on 3G
- ✅ Time to Interactive <3s

---

**Next Steps**: Frontend Specialist agent will use this baseline to measure optimization impact.
