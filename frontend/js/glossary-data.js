// SommOS Glossary Data
// Comprehensive definitions for wine terminology, system metrics, user roles, and features

/**
 * Glossary Data Maintenance Guide
 * ================================
 * 
 * Updating the Glossary:
 * - To add new terms: Add entries to the appropriate category in the glossaryData object below
 * - Structure for each term: { "Term Name": { definition: "...", examples: [...] } }
 * - Available categories: "Wine Terminology", "System Metrics", "User Roles", "Features & Actions"
 * 
 * When to Update:
 * - When adding new system features or metrics that users should understand
 * - When introducing new wine domain terminology in the UI
 * - When user feedback indicates confusion about existing terms
 * 
 * Best Practices:
 * - Keep definitions concise but comprehensive (2-3 sentences ideal)
 * - Provide 1-3 practical examples for each term
 * - Use consistent terminology across all glossary entries
 * - Update relevant documentation (WARP.md, README.md) when adding system-related terms
 * 
 * Note: This is a static data file. Changes require code deployment.
 * For dynamic glossary management, consider implementing an admin UI in the future.
