# SommOS Environment Configuration (Local Development)

## Core Application Settings
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001

## External Services
# Base URL for the Open-Meteo archive API. A default is supplied for non-production
# environments; production deployments must provide an explicit value.
OPEN_METEO_BASE=https://archive-api.open-meteo.com/v1/archive

## Persistence
# SQLite database path used for offline-first storage.
DATABASE_PATH=./data/sommos.db

## Authentication Secrets (⚠️ CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION SECURITY)
## Feature Flags
# Set to "true" to prevent outbound HTTP calls (useful for tests and demos).
# When enabled, this affects:
# - Weather API calls (Open-Meteo)
# - AI pairing services (DeepSeek/OpenAI)
# - All external integrations
SOMMOS_DISABLE_EXTERNAL_CALLS=false

# ⚠️  SECURITY: Authentication bypass for development/testing ONLY
# This flag is automatically blocked in production environments
# SOMMOS_AUTH_DISABLED=false  # Uncomment ONLY for local development

## Optional Integrations
# AI-powered wine pairing and tasting notes
# The system uses DeepSeek as the primary AI provider with automatic fallback:
# 1. DEEPSEEK_API_KEY (preferred) - Get from: https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys
# 3. Traditional algorithm (if no AI keys configured)
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# API key for enhanced weather intelligence integrations (optional).
WEATHER_API_KEY=

## Test & Benchmark Controls
# Override the number of records generated by performance fixtures.
PERFORMANCE_TEST_DATASET_SIZE=500

## Developer Utilities
# Uncomment during local development to bypass authentication safeguards.
# SOMMOS_AUTH_TEST_BYPASS=true
