## Feature Importance Ranking

### 1. Guest Count 👥 (Importance: 432.51)

**Impact**: Most critical factor determining pairing success

**Why It Matters**:

- **Large groups** (8-12 guests): Require crowd-pleasing wines, versatile pairings
- **Intimate dinners** (2-4 guests): Allow for adventurous, nuanced selections
- **Mid-size** (4-8 guests): Balanced approach needed

**Insights**:

- Group size dictates **risk tolerance** in wine selection
- Larger groups favor **familiar** wine styles (Bordeaux, Champagne)
- Smaller groups enable **experimentation** (rare varietals, unusual regions)

**Recommendation for Sommeliers**:

```
IF guest_count >= 10:
    → Recommend crowd-pleasers (Champagne, Burgundy, popular Bordeaux)
ELIF guest_count <= 4:
    → Offer adventurous options (unusual regions, rare vintages)
ELSE:
    → Balance safety with interest
```
