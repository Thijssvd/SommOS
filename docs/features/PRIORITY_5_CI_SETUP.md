# Priority 5: Configuration & CI - IN PROGRESS

## Mission

Configure Jest for optimal test discovery and coverage, set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, and establish quality gates.

---

## ✅ Completed

### 1. Jest Configuration Improvements ✅

**File:** `jest.config.js`

**Changes Made:**

- ✅ Updated testMatch patterns to include `*.spec.js` files
- ✅ Added comprehensive testPathIgnorePatterns
  - E2E tests (Playwright)
  - Frontend static files
  - Data directories
  - Coverage output
  - Archived files
- ✅ Increased coverage thresholds significantly:
  - **Global:** 30-40% (was 2-3%)
  - **Inventory Manager:** 75-80% target
  - **Procurement Engine:** 65-70% target
  - **Pairing Engine:** 60-65% target
  - **Middleware:** 60-70% target

**Impact:** Better test discovery, realistic quality gates

### 2. GitHub Actions CI Pipeline ✅

**File:** `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

**Features Implemented:**

- ✅ **Multi-version testing:** Node 18.x and 20.x
- ✅ **Jest test execution** with coverage reporting
- ✅ **Playwright E2E tests** with artifact uploads
- ✅ **Flakiness detection** - runs tests 3 times
- ✅ **Coverage uploads** to Codecov
- ✅ **Test summary** job aggregating results
- ✅ **Artifact storage:**
  - Coverage reports (30 days)
  - Playwright reports (30 days)
  - Test results (7 days)
  - Flakiness logs (7 days)

**Workflow Jobs:**

1. `jest-tests` - Unit & integration tests
2. `playwright-tests` - E2E browser tests
3. `test-flakiness-detection` - Detect inconsistent tests
4. `test-summary` - Aggregate and report

## 📊 Test Suite Current State

### From Last Test Run

```
Test Suites: 12 failed, 25 passed, 37 total (67.6% pass rate)
Tests:       177 failed, 447 passed, 3 skipped, 627 total (71.3% pass rate)
Time:        70.729 s
```

### Known Issues

1. ****tests**/performance-scalability.test.js**
   - Error: `db.connect is not a function`
   - Database API mismatch

2. **Backend ML test suites**
   - Located in `backend/test/ml/`
   - Use custom TestRunner (not Jest compatible)
   - Currently excluded from Jest runs

3. **177 failing tests**
   - Mostly in ML integration tests
   - Database setup issues
   - Some ParallelProcessingEngine issues (mostly fixed)

---

## ⏳ Remaining Work

### High Priority

1. **Fix db.connect() error** in performance-scalability test
2. **Add missing API route tests** - identify untested endpoints
3. **Document ML test suite** conversion plan

### Medium Priority

4. **Run full validation** after fixes
5. **Add README badges** for CI status and coverage
6. **Create coverage badge workflow**

### Low Priority (Future)

7. Convert `backend/test/ml/` tests to Jest
8. Add mutation testing
9. Set up pre-commit hooks
10. Add test parallelization optimization

---

## 📋 Coverage Threshold Strategy

### Progressive Improvement Plan

**Phase 1: Current (Realistic)**

- Global: 30-40%
- Well-tested modules: 60-80%

**Phase 2: Medium-term (3-6 months)**

- Global: 50-60%
- Well-tested modules: 80-85%
- Critical paths: 90%+

**Phase 3: Long-term (6-12 months)**

- Global: 70%+
- All core modules: 80%+
- Critical business logic: 95%+

## 🔧 Jest Configuration Details

### Test Discovery

```javascript
testMatch: [
  '**/tests/**/*.test.js',  // Standard test files
  '**/__tests__/**/*.test.js', // Colocated tests
  '**/tests/**/*.spec.js'   // Alternative naming
]
```

### Ignored Paths

```javascript
testPathIgnorePatterns: [
  '/node_modules/',      // Dependencies
  '/backend/test/ml/',   // Custom test runner
  '/tests/e2e/',         // Playwright tests
  '/frontend/',          // Static files
  '/data/',              // Data files
  '/coverage/',          // Coverage output
  '\\.archived$'         // Archived files
]
```

### Test Projects

11 specialized test projects:

1. Backend API Tests
2. Auth API Tests
3. API Contract Tests
4. Frontend Unit Tests (jsdom)
5. Integration Tests
6. Performance Tests
7. Browser Compatibility (jsdom)
8. Sync Workflow Tests
9. Security Tests
10. Config Tests
11. ML Algorithm Tests

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Features

### Flakiness Detection

Runs tests 3 times on push to detect inconsistent tests:

- Compares pass/fail counts across runs
- Generates analysis in GitHub Step Summary
- Uploads logs as artifacts

### Coverage Integration

- Uploads to Codecov on main branch
- Stores HTML reports as artifacts
- Tracks coverage trends over time

### Multi-Node Testing

Tests on both Node 18.x and 20.x to ensure compatibility

### Artifact Management

- **Coverage:** 30-day retention
- **E2E Reports:** 30-day retention
- **Test Results:** 7-day retention
- **Flakiness Logs:** 7-day retention

## 📖 Usage

### Run Tests Locally

```bash
# All Jest tests with coverage
npm test

# Jest tests without coverage
npm test -- --no-coverage

# Specific test suite
npm test -- tests/backend/api.test.js

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run Playwright E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Run Playwright in UI mode
npx playwright test --ui
```

### Coverage Reports

```bash
# Generate coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# View HTML report
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html

# View summary
npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=text-summary
```

### CI Locally (via act)

```bash
# Install act (GitHub Actions local runner)

# Run Jest tests locally
act -j jest-tests

# Run all workflows
act push
```
