# Wine Images - Quick Start Guide 🚀

## ⚡ TL;DR - Get Started in 5 Minutes

### 1. Get Unsplash API Key (2 minutes)
```bash
# Visit: https://unsplash.com/developers
# Create app, copy "Access Key"
```

### 2. Add to Environment (30 seconds)
```bash
# Edit .env file
nano .env

# Find line 31 and replace:
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here
# With your actual key:
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
```

### 3. Start Server (1 minute)
```bash
cd /Users/thijs/Documents/SommOS
npm start
```

### 4. Test! (2 minutes)
- Open browser to `http://localhost:3001`
- Login
- Go to Inventory page
- See beautiful wine bottle images! 🍷

## ✅ What's Already Done

Everything is implemented and ready to use:

- ✅ Backend service integrated
- ✅ Database migrated
- ✅ Frontend components updated  
- ✅ CSS styling added
- ✅ Image optimization enabled
- ✅ NPM packages installed

**You only need to add your Unsplash API key!**

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### When You Create a Wine:
1. You submit wine details (name, producer, year)
2. Backend automatically searches Unsplash for bottle image
3. Image URL is saved to database
4. Frontend displays image with lazy loading
5. If search fails → placeholder is used

### No Manual Image Uploads Needed!
The system finds images automatically based on:
- Producer name
- Wine name
- Vintage year
- Wine type/varietal

---

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Backend (2 minutes)
```bash
# Start server
npm start

# Look for this message in logs:
# ✓ ImageService initialized with Unsplash API

# Create a test wine via UI or API
# Check logs for:
# ✓ Found image for [Wine Name]: [URL]
```

### Frontend (3 minutes)
1. Navigate to **Inventory** page
   - See wine images at top of cards ✅
   - Watch skeleton animation → image fade ✅
   - Hover over card → image zooms slightly ✅

2. Navigate to **Catalog** page
   - Switch between Grid/List/Detail views ✅
   - Images adjust size automatically ✅
   - Scroll → images load lazily ✅

3. Check DevTools Network tab
   - Images load only when visible ✅
   - No unnecessary requests ✅

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "ImageService initialized without Unsplash API key"
→ Add API key to `.env` file (see step 2 above)

### Images not showing
→ Check browser console for errors
→ Verify `.env` has correct API key
→ Restart server after updating `.env`

### "Rate Limit Exceeded"
→ Free tier: 50 requests/hour
→ Wait 1 hour or images will use placeholder

## 📁 Key Files

### Backend
- `backend/api/routes.js` - Image service integration
- `backend/services/imageService.js` - Image lookup logic
- `.env` - API key configuration

### Frontend
- `frontend/js/app.js` - Wine card rendering
- `frontend/css/styles.css` - Image styles (lines 3129-3305)
- `frontend/images/wine-placeholder.svg` - Fallback image

### Database
- `data/sommos.db` - Contains `image_url` column in Wines table

---

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:

1. **Server logs**:
   ```
   ✓ ImageService initialized with Unsplash API
   ImageService: Searching Unsplash for "Chateau Margaux 2015 wine bottle"
   ✓ Found image for Chateau Margaux: https://images.unsplash.com/...
   ```

2. **Wine cards**:
   - Display bottle images at top
   - Shimmer animation while loading
   - Smooth fade-in when loaded
   - Zoom effect on hover

3. **Network tab**:
   - Images from `images.unsplash.com`
   - OR `/images/wine-placeholder.svg`
   - Load only when scrolled into view

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Development
- Free tier gives 50 requests/hour (plenty for testing!)
- Images are cached in DB (only lookup once per wine)
- Placeholder always works (no API needed)

### For Production
- Monitor API usage in Unsplash dashboard
- Consider image CDN for better performance
- Upgrade plan if needed (5K requests/month free)

### For Testing
- Create wines with well-known names first
  - "Chateau Margaux", "Opus One", "Penfolds Grange"
- Check logs to see search process
- Test with obscure wines to see fallback behavior
