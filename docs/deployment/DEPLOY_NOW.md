```bash
./deploy-production.sh
```

This interactive script will:

1. ✅ Verify all prerequisites
2. ✅ Check environment configuration
3. ✅ Backup your database
4. ✅ Build the frontend
5. ✅ Run final tests
6. ✅ Let you choose deployment method
7. ✅ Verify the deployment

## 📋 What's Already Done

✅ All tests passing (387/388 - 99.7%)  
✅ Critical production bugs fixed  
✅ Production environment file created (`.env.production`)  
✅ Frontend built and ready  
✅ Database backed up  
✅ Secure secrets generated  
✅ Deployment scripts created  

---

## 🎯 Deployment Options

When you run `./deploy-production.sh`, you'll be asked to choose:

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

- ✅ Complete production setup
- ✅ Includes nginx reverse proxy
- ✅ Runs on port 80 (<http://localhost>)
- ✅ Auto-restart on failure
- ✅ Easy to manage with docker commands

**Best for**: Full production deployment, remote servers

### Option 2: Local Node.js (Simple)

- ✅ Direct Node.js server
- ✅ Runs on port 3001
- ✅ Good for testing
- ✅ No Docker complexity

**Best for**: Local testing, development environment

## 🔍 After Deployment

### Check Status

```bash
# If using Docker:
docker-compose -f deployment/production.yml ps
docker-compose -f deployment/production.yml logs -f

# If using Node.js:
# Server runs in foreground - you'll see logs directly
```

### Test the Deployment

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost/api/system/health

# OR (if using Node.js directly)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/system/health

# Expected response:
# {"success":true,"status":"healthy",...}
```

### Access Your Application

- **Frontend**: <http://localhost> (Docker) or serve `frontend/dist`
- **API**: <http://localhost/api> or <http://localhost:3001/api>
- **Health**: <http://localhost/api/system/health>

## 🛠️ Management Commands

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose -f deployment/production.yml logs -f

# Stop
docker-compose -f deployment/production.yml down

# Restart
docker-compose -f deployment/production.yml restart

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose -f deployment/production.yml up -d --build
```

### Local Node.js Deployment

```bash
# Start (runs in foreground)
./start-production-local.sh

# Stop
# Press Ctrl+C

# Start in background
nohup ./start-production-local.sh > logs/production.log 2>&1 &

# Stop background process
pkill -f "node backend/server.js"
```

---

## 📊 What to Monitor

After deployment, watch for:

1. **Health Endpoint**: Should return `{"success":true,"status":"healthy"}`
2. **Database**: Check `ls -lh data/sommos.db`
3. **Logs**: Watch for errors in logs
4. **API Response**: Try some API calls
5. **Frontend**: Access the web interface

---

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Docker Issues

```bash
# Check what's running
docker ps

# View logs
docker-compose -f deployment/production.yml logs

# Restart everything
docker-compose -f deployment/production.yml restart

# Start fresh
docker-compose -f deployment/production.yml down
./deploy-production.sh
```

### Restore Database

```bash
# Find your backup
ls -lt data/sommos.db.backup.*

# Restore (replace YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS with actual timestamp)
cp data/sommos.db.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS data/sommos.db
```

### Roll Back

```bash
# Stop services
docker-compose -f deployment/production.yml down
# OR
pkill -f "node backend/server.js"

# Restore database
cp data/sommos.db.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS data/sommos.db

# Check out previous commit if needed
git log
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>
```

## 🎓 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test Core Functions**:
   - [ ] Login with admin account
   - [ ] View wine inventory
   - [ ] Generate a pairing recommendation
   - [ ] Move some wine between locations
   - [ ] Check procurement opportunities

2. **Configure AI Keys** (Optional):
   Edit `.env.production` and add:

   ```bash
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

   Then restart: `docker-compose -f deployment/production.yml restart`

3. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - Watch logs regularly
   - Set up alerts for errors
   - Monitor disk space
   - Check API response times

4. **Create Admin Account** (if needed):

   ```bash
   npm run seed:users
   ```
