## Table Structure

### Events Table

The `Events` table is the core entity for tracking yacht events:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (event_type IN (
        'charter',           -- Charter trip with external guests
        'private_use',       -- Yacht owner's private use
        'special_occasion',  -- Birthday, anniversary, celebration
        'regular_service'    -- Standard yacht operations
    )),
    event_name TEXT,
    start_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    end_date DATETIME,
    guest_count INTEGER CHECK (guest_count >= 0),
    charter_company TEXT,
    primary_contact TEXT,
    location TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT (strftime('%s','now')),
    created_by TEXT DEFAULT 'system'
);
```

### Foreign Key Relationships

The following tables now include an `event_id` column (nullable):

- **LearningPairingSessions** - Links pairing sessions to events
- **LearningPairingSessionsEnhanced** - Links ML-enhanced sessions to events
- **LearningPairingFeedback** - Associates feedback with events
- **LearningPairingFeedbackEnhanced** - Links granular feedback to events
- **LearningConsumptionEvents** - Tracks consumption during events
- **ExperimentEvents** - Links A/B testing to yacht events

All foreign keys use `ON DELETE SET NULL` to preserve data if an event is deleted.

## Analytical Views

### 1. EventConsumptionSummary

Aggregates wine consumption statistics by event:

```sql
SELECT * FROM EventConsumptionSummary WHERE event_id = 1;
```

**Columns**:

- `event_id`, `event_name`, `event_type`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `guest_count`
- `total_consumption_events` - Number of consumption records
- `unique_wines_consumed` - Count of distinct vintages
- `total_bottles_consumed` - Total bottles consumed (event_type='consume')
- `total_bottles_received` - Total bottles received (event_type='receive')
- `locations_used` - Comma-separated list of storage locations used
- `wine_types_consumed` - Comma-separated list of wine types consumed

**Example**:

```sql
-- Get consumption summary for all charter events this year
SELECT 
    event_name,
    guest_count,
    total_bottles_consumed,
    unique_wines_consumed,
    ROUND(CAST(total_bottles_consumed AS REAL) / guest_count, 2) as bottles_per_guest
FROM EventConsumptionSummary
WHERE event_type = 'charter'
  AND start_date >= date('now', 'start of year')
ORDER BY start_date DESC;
```

### 2. EventPairingSuccessRates

Calculates pairing recommendation success metrics:

```sql
SELECT * FROM EventPairingSuccessRates WHERE event_id = 1;
```

**Columns**:

- `event_id`, `event_name`, `event_type`, `start_date`, `end_date`
- `total_pairing_sessions` - Number of pairing sessions
- `total_feedback_entries` - Number of feedback records
- `avg_rating` - Average feedback rating (1-5 scale)
- `ai_generated_sessions` - Count of AI-enhanced pairings
- `traditional_sessions` - Count of traditional sommelier pairings
- `ai_avg_rating` - Average rating for AI pairings
- `traditional_avg_rating` - Average rating for traditional pairings
- `selected_recommendations` - Number of recommendations actually selected
- `selection_rate` - Percentage of recommendations selected

**Example**:

```sql
-- Compare AI vs traditional pairing success by event type
SELECT 
    event_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT event_id) as event_count,
    AVG(ai_avg_rating) as avg_ai_rating,
    AVG(traditional_avg_rating) as avg_traditional_rating,
    AVG(selection_rate) * 100 as avg_selection_rate_pct
FROM EventPairingSuccessRates
GROUP BY event_type
HAVING event_count > 0;
```

### 3. EventWinePreferences

Identifies wine preferences by event type for collaborative filtering:

```sql
SELECT * FROM EventWinePreferences WHERE event_type = 'charter' LIMIT 10;
```

**Columns**:

- `event_type`, `event_name`, `wine_type`, `region`, `country`
- `consumption_count` - Number of consumption events
- `total_bottles` - Total bottles consumed
- `avg_feedback_rating` - Average pairing feedback rating
- `events_with_wine` - Number of events featuring this wine
- `avg_bottles_per_event` - Average consumption per event

**Example**:

```sql
-- Find top wine preferences for charter events
SELECT 
    wine_type,
    region,
    country,
    SUM(total_bottles) as total_consumed,
    AVG(avg_feedback_rating) as avg_rating,
    COUNT(DISTINCT event_name) as events_count
FROM EventWinePreferences
WHERE event_type = 'charter'
GROUP BY wine_type, region, country
ORDER BY total_consumed DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 4. EventOverview

Comprehensive event summary combining all metrics:

```sql
SELECT * FROM EventOverview ORDER BY start_date DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**Columns**: All event details plus:

- `bottles_consumed`, `unique_wines`, `pairing_sessions`
- `avg_pairing_rating`, `recommendation_selection_rate`
- `duration_days`, `bottles_per_guest`

**Example**:

```sql
-- Get overview of recent high-consumption events
SELECT 
    event_name,
    event_type,
    guest_count,
    bottles_consumed,
    bottles_per_guest,
    avg_pairing_rating,
    duration_days
FROM EventOverview
WHERE start_date >= date('now', '-90 days')
  AND bottles_consumed > 0
ORDER BY bottles_consumed DESC;
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Creating a Charter Event

```javascript
// In your API or service layer
async function createCharterEvent(eventData) {
    const db = Database.getInstance();
    
    const result = await db.run(`
        INSERT INTO Events (
            event_type, event_name, start_date, end_date,
            guest_count, charter_company, primary_contact,
            location, notes, created_by
        ) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
    `, [
        'charter',
        eventData.name,
        eventData.startDate,
        eventData.endDate,
        eventData.guestCount,
        eventData.charterCompany,
        eventData.contact,
        eventData.itinerary,
        eventData.notes,
        eventData.userId
    ]);
    
    return result.lastID;
}
```

### 2. Linking Consumption to an Event

```javascript
// When recording wine consumption
async function recordConsumption(consumptionData) {
    const db = Database.getInstance();
    
    await db.run(`
        INSERT INTO LearningConsumptionEvents (
            vintage_id, wine_id, wine_type, quantity,
            location, event_type, event_id, metadata
        ) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
    `, [
        consumptionData.vintageId,
        consumptionData.wineId,
        consumptionData.wineType,
        consumptionData.quantity,
        consumptionData.location,
        'consume',
        consumptionData.eventId,  // Link to event
        JSON.stringify(consumptionData.metadata)
    ]);
}
```

### 3. Event-Based Collaborative Filtering

```javascript
// Find similar events and recommend wines
async function getRecommendationsFromSimilarEvents(currentEventId) {
    const db = Database.getInstance();
    
    // Get current event details
    const currentEvent = await db.get(
        'SELECT event_type, guest_count FROM Events WHERE id = ?',
        [currentEventId]
    );
    
    // Find wines popular in similar events
    const recommendations = await db.all(`
        SELECT 
            wine_type,
            region,
            country,
            AVG(avg_feedback_rating) as avg_rating,
            SUM(total_bottles) as popularity
        FROM EventWinePreferences
        WHERE event_type = ?
          AND events_with_wine >= 2
        GROUP BY wine_type, region, country
        ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, popularity DESC
        LIMIT 10
    `, [currentEvent.event_type]);
    
    return recommendations;
}
```

### 4. Event Performance Analytics

```javascript
// Analyze charter performance over time
async function getCharterPerformanceReport(startDate, endDate) {
    const db = Database.getInstance();
    
    return await db.all(`
        SELECT 
            strftime('%Y-%m', start_date) as month,
            COUNT(*) as charter_count,
            SUM(guest_count) as total_guests,
            AVG(bottles_per_guest) as avg_bottles_per_guest,
            AVG(avg_pairing_rating) as avg_satisfaction,
            SUM(bottles_consumed) as total_consumed
        FROM EventOverview
        WHERE event_type = 'charter'
          AND start_date BETWEEN ? AND ?
        GROUP BY strftime('%Y-%m', start_date)
        ORDER BY month DESC
    `, [startDate, endDate]);
}
```

### 5. Linking Pairing Sessions to Events

```javascript
// When generating pairings for an event
async function generateEventPairings(eventId, dishDescription, preferences) {
    const pairingEngine = new PairingEngine(db);
    
    // Generate pairings
    const pairings = await pairingEngine.generatePairings(
        dishDescription,
        { ...preferences, eventId },  // Include eventId in context
        preferences
    );
    
    // Update session with event_id
    if (pairings.recommendations?.[0]?.learning_session_id) {
        await db.run(
            'UPDATE LearningPairingSessions SET event_id = ? WHERE id = ?',
            [eventId, pairings.recommendations[0].learning_session_id]
        );
    }
    
    return pairings;
}
```

## Database Indexes

Performance indexes are automatically created for common query patterns:

- `idx_events_type` - Filter by event type
- `idx_events_dates` - Date range queries
- `idx_events_created` - Recent events queries
- `idx_events_guest_count` - Guest count filtering
- `idx_learning_*_event` - Foreign key join performance

---

## Migration Compatibility

The migration is **backward compatible**:

- All `event_id` columns are **nullable**
- Existing data is not affected
- Foreign keys use `ON DELETE SET NULL`
- Views handle NULL event_id gracefully

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the Events system:

1. **Event Templates**: Pre-configured event types with default wine selections
2. **Event Budget Tracking**: Link procurement and consumption to event budgets
3. **Guest Profiles**: Individual guest preferences linked to events
4. **Event Series**: Group related events (e.g., "Summer 2025 Charter Season")
5. **Automated Event Detection**: ML-based event boundary detection from consumption patterns
6. **Event Comparison Tool**: Compare similar events for performance benchmarking
